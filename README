Mail::SpamAssassin::SpamCopURI
===========

SpamCopURI is a hacked plugin to fit in to SA.


This module currently interacts with sc.surbl.org,
which pulls its data from spamcop at 
http://www.spamcop.net/w3m?action=inprogress&type=www

to determine whether a URL is spam or not.

Currently you can assign scores when a URL's domain is detected
as being spammy.  The following 
are the recommended settings.

    uri SPAMCOP_URI_RBL           eval:check_spamcop_uri_rbl('sc.surbl.org','127.0.0.2')
    describe SPAMCOP_URI_RBL      URI's domain appears in spamcop database at sc.surbl.org
    tflags SPAMCOP_URI_RBL	net

    score SPAMCOP_URI_RBL  3.0


An experimental option was added that will resolve open redirects to 
handle spammers that hide behind sites such as rd.yahoo.com and snipurl.com.

This is disabled by default, but can be enabled with the following settings:

  spamcop_uri_resolve_open_redirects 1 
  open_redirect_list_spamcop_uri   rd.yahoo.com

This will attempt to get the Location header from rd.yahoo.com, but
it will not follow the redirect.  If several open redirects are chained 
together, this will recurse up to 4 times in attempting to resolve the 
Location header.  This setting is dependent upon LWP and will simply
return false if LWP is not found.  The LWP timeout is set to 5 seconds.
I can make this a configuration option if anyone feels the need to tweak
this in some way.

See the rules file for more examples of open redirect sites.

Limitations:
  Currently, either rule can only be hit once because of the way SA
  does its rule processing.  Future versions may generate a some sort of
  dynamic name based on the URL.
